rHome


rHome is a simple arduino & python3 based smarthome system which uses i2c over cat6/7 cables for communication.

The goal is to have maximum redundancy, minimal interaction with the internet and to provide a strong 
though tightly bound set of core functionalities while providing the option of reasonable expandability.
